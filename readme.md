# XD Comments to CSV

Adobe XD comments/annotations are not easy to copy/paste. This snippet will allow you (at time of posting) to extract all comments to a CSV format for review.

  - If you want to pull all comments, toggle "all screen comments" at the bottom of the page
  - Copy the output from the console to a text editor and save as a .csv file
  - Import the .csv file to Excel, ensure you've set commas as the delimiter. 

# Notes

  - This will not clean the comments and will not account for user errors. (example: filling out the username content with a comment).
  - Annotation numbers only appear for the active page in the preview pane. You can run this separately for each page where there are many annotations, but you will either need to save the csv for each or manually modify the content of your CSV file.
  - You will likely need to review the output in excel and do a minor bit of cleanup to suit your needs.
